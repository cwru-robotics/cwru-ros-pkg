created irb120 model, based on Gazebo tutoriao of rrbot

roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch

had to elim collision model for 1st two links to get rid of instability.

next step--create motor controllers

----------March 9-----
did: 
*roscore
*xxx THIS IS REDUNDANT xxxrosrun gazebo_ros gazebo
*roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch
*roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch

looks encouraging...claims to recognize /rrbot/joint1_position_controller/command topic

from here: http://gazebosim.org/tutorials/?tut=ros_control

did this: xxxx SKIP THIS STEP??
rosservice call /rrbot/controller_manager/switch_controller "{start_controllers: ['joint1_position_controller','joint2_position_controller'], stop_controllers: [], strictness: 2}"


rostopic pub -1 /rrbot/joint1_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.5"
 DID cause jnt1 to move!
 
rostopic pub -1 /rrbot/joint2_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.0"
 DID cause jnt2 to move!  (poor gains)
 
 --------- March 10:  abby_wsn_dev ---------
 
 edited rrbot_control.yaml; could not restart gazebo (unrelated?)
 
 (started 2 joint controllers only)
 
 rebooted; Gazebo OK (problem with dual launches of gazebo?)
 
 moved joints--still sluggish, and also oscillatory
 
 rrbot.xacro does specify 6 transmissions and motors
 rrbot.gazebo: 
 rrbot_control/launch/rrbot_contro.launch:  specifies launching joint controllers;
    add a joint3 controller; (launch then did load 3 controllers)
    
 rostopic pub -1 /rrbot/joint3_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.0"   
 worked!! (now have 3-joint control)
 
 here is output from successful 3-joint rrbot_control launch:

--------
increase P gains to 10,000; remove I gain; increase D gains to 100
rqt_plot shows torque saturation at +/- 10N-m (joint1)

In rrbot.xacro, increase joint effort saturations to 100
e.g.:    <limit effort="100" lower="-1.91986" upper="1.22173" velocity="4.36332"/>  

hmm...broke the robot?  
hmm...started working.  Don't know why. 
also, j3 controller responds, but did not use service to start it. (this step unnecessary???)
very oscillatory;
set gains P=1000, d= 100
gzclient died; complaints from gazebo about reloading controller; killed and restarted

response looks quite good; extend to more joints...

gazebo gives this complaint:

Did NOT start controllers manually via service (seems to be part of controller launch)

rostopic pub -1 /rrbot/joint6_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: 1.0" 

all 6 joints work!  (low saturation efforts and gains on joints 4-6; could use tuning)

-----NEXT---
want node to publish to 
/rrbot/joint6_position_controller/command, etc

try:
rosrun example_robot_interface example_robot_interface
rosrun example_robot_interface test_traj_sin_sender
  (v1 of sender: saw J1 do step motions at 1Hz)
 
 sending sin wave w/ updates at 10Hz shows controller-effort sawtooth; should send joint commands faster than this
 
 extended test_traj_sin_sender to 6 joints--looks good; rqt_plot of joint positions is good;
  used angle increments of 0.1 rad, amplitude = 0.5 rad, npts = 100;
  looks pretty good, with example_robot_interface updating commands at 10Hz
  
view in rviz (choose "world" as fixed frame)
 link7 frame has origin on tool flange face, x-axis points out, normal to flange
 
 Modified example_robot_interface:
 now responds to duration argument;
 
 tested with: rosrun example_robot_interface test_traj_sin_sender 
 
 ----RECAP------
 *roscore
 *roslaunch rrbot_gazebo rrbot_world.launch
 *roslaunch rrbot_control rrbot_control.launch
 *rosrun example_robot_interface example_robot_interface
 
 then command motions with:
 *rosrun example_robot_interface test_traj_sin_sender (replace this with application)
 
 
---- next: IK?
  (make this a library)
  
  final frame (in Gazebo, link7; in rviz, also link7)
  at home pose, final (tool-flange) frame points aligned with base frame (x-axis points out of flange, along world x, etc)
  BUT, DH says final frame at home pose is:
   [ 0  0  1
     0  1  0
     -1 0  0]
   origin at [0.374; 0; 0.63] seems to agree with Gazebo (accounting for some droop)
     is exact with gravity set to 0 (and RPY = 0,0,0)
     
     
  TEST TEST TEST:
  ran rosrun example_robot_interface test_traj_point_sender
    w/ joint cmds set to 0.1, 0.2 ...0.6
    set gravity in Gazebo to zero
    observed link7 position and orientation (RPY)
    
  In irb120_kinematics_test_main, set R-P-Y values to output of Gazebo;
    converted these to Rotation matrix to see target 3x3
    Specified fwd_kin of same q_cmd (0.1, 0.2... 0.6)
    ran: rosrun irb120_ik irb120_kinematics_test_main
    Got precise agreement, Gazebo and irb120_kinematics
    
  FWD KIN WORKS;  NEXT, DO INV KIN
  
  ---------March 11----------
  implemented IK w/rt wrist point (q1,q2,q3 solutions).
  ran test main, which generated random q values, called fwd kin,
  used A_fwd_DH result to call ik_solver.ik_solve(A_fwd_DH);
  print out wrist coords.  WORKS!!
  
  added tests to limit solutions to solutions within joint ranges
