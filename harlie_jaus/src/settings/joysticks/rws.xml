             attributes are as follows:
             
             input = user defined. For a joystick the input/axis are (X = 0,Y,Z,R,U,V,POV,POVX,POVY = 8).
             deadzone = percentage of a deadzone to use with input (e.g. joystick axis) [0,100] 
             invert = true/false  (Invert the Axis) 
             limit = [0,100] Maximum wrench effort value that can be sent.
             wrench = Wrench effort to map axis to.  Values are:
                 Propulsive Linear Effort X = 0,
                 Propulsive Linear Effort Y = 1,
                 Propulsive Linear Effort Z = 2,
                 Propulsive Rotational Effort X = 3,
                 Propulsive Rotational Effort Y = 4,
                 Propulsive Rotational Effort Z = 5,
                 Resistive Linear Effort X = 6,
